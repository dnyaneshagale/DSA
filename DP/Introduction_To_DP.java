     * It is Optimized recursion

     *  + How to identify
     *  - 1. Asked for Optimal Solution (Least, Most, Min, Max, Smallest, Largest)
     *  
     *  - 2. Some choice is given. (It may form multiple branches in Recursion Tree type of thing)
     * 
     * 
     *  + Definition : (Tell in Interview)
     *  - Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming, that helps to efficiently solve a 
     *      class of problems that have "Overlapping Subproblems" & "Optimal Substructure" property.
     * 
     *  + Ways of DP :
     *  - 1. Memoization (Top-Down Approach).
     *  - 2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach).
     * 
     *  + 1. Memoization :
     *     I. Normal Recursion
     *    II. Subproblems
     *   III. Storage -> Reuse
     * 
     *  
     *  + 2. Tabulation :
     *     I. Efficiemt
     *    II. Iteration is Used.
     *   III. Table/Set/Storage
     *  Steps : 
     *      1. Initialization
     *      2. Meaning
     *      3. Filling (Small to Large).
